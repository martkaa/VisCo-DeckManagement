This program is a solution to the problem of Deck Management of Cargos, which myself and Vetle Chyba Nordstad worked on summer 2021 on behalf of VisCo. 

The program is written in Python with the Anaconda Navigator. 

The solution has taken form as an independent program which takes an Excel sheet containing cargo info as input and returns an Excel sheet containing 
the wanted information about placement of each cargo on the platform.
